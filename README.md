# Air-Quality-Data-Analysis

This is my recent project focused on 𝑨𝒊𝒓 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 Analysis, where I examined pollution levels across Indian cities. 
This project was an opportunity to not only dive deep into data but also to uncover meaningful patterns that could drive impactful environmental decisions.    

The Objective:  
The primary goal was to analyze air quality trends, identify key pollutants, and explore geographical and temporal patterns using a cleaned dataset and interactive Power BI dashboards. By highlighting areas of concern and uncovering opportunities, I aimed to provide actionable insights for policymakers and environmental advocates.    

Key Steps in the Process:  
✅ Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, standardized data formats, and removed inconsistencies like placeholder rows.  
✅ Visualization: Created dynamic bar charts, line graphs, and maps to showcase AQI trends, pollutant distributions, and city comparisons.  
✅ Insights: Found cities like Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna facing high pollution, while coastal cities showed better air quality. Seasonal patterns and a positive AQI decline (2015-2020) also stood out!    

Key Findings and Recommendations:  
🔍 Findings:  
Top Polluted Cities: Ahmedabad (AQI 429), Delhi (AQI 259), and Patna (AQI 235).  
Cleanest Cities: Coimbatore (AQI 73), Shillong (AQI 52), and Aizawl (AQI 35).  
Temporal Insights: AQI improved significantly from an average of 192 in 2015 to 113 in 2020.  

💡 Recommendations:  
1. Strengthen emission regulations for industries and vehicles.  
2. Invest in urban greenery to improve air quality naturally.  
3. Launch public awareness campaigns about pollution reduction strategies.  
4. Expand air quality monitoring networks to provide real-time, localized data.  
5. Promote sustainable infrastructure such as green transportation and better urban planning.  

Why It Matters:  
This project isn’t just about analyzing data—it’s about making a difference. The insights gained have the potential to influence policy, raise awareness, and guide action toward improving air quality and public health.  

By leveraging data, we can answer critical questions:  
1. How can urban centers like Delhi manage their persistent air quality challenges?  
2. What lessons can coastal cities teach us about mitigating pollution?  
3. How can correlations between pollutants drive more targeted interventions?  

Takeaways:  
    This experience reinforced how foundational processes like data cleaning and visualization can reveal profound insights. By using tools like Power BI, I was able to transform raw data into a compelling narrative that advocates for cleaner air and sustainable living.
